Notes -
🔵 genius is too inconsistent, better not to use 

Currently working on -
🟡 make lrclib fetch robust to network issues 
🟡 fix lrclib

To work on -
🔴 apply best coding practices, normalize and optimize the codebase
🔴 add option to auto embed lyrics to tracks 
🔴 deep search, if required 
🔴 if lyris are already embedded, skip the song
🔴 add source: lyricsfind-via-ytmusic/google
🔴 switch to official spotify api when developer dashboard app creation becomes available

Finished working on -
🟢 use all sources together 
🟢 use relative paths 
🟢 move config to project root
🟢 best lyrics item match - reject if title, artist, album doesn't match
🟢 lead lyrics by around 1 second
🟢 cache unsynced lyrics if found to avoid double fetch
